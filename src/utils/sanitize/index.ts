/**
 * The rule registry.
 *
 * Registry order must not be load-bearing. `applySanitizeFixes` iterates in array
 * order, which makes it tempting to let one rule clean up after another — don't.
 * Rules are individually selectable in the UI, so any rule that only produces
 * correct output when a later rule also runs is broken for every user who unchecks
 * that later rule. Each `fix()` must leave the layout in a state where every rule's
 * `scan()` is accurate, its own and every other rule's alike.
 *
 * To add a rule: drop a new `*.rule.ts` in `./rules` implementing `SanitizeRule`
 * (including its `kind`) and add it here. The panel UI, its grouping, scan
 * orchestration, Apply logic, and the result tally all pick it up automatically.
 * A rule that reports without fixing simply omits `fix`.
